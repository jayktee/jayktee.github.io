I'm a researcher at the [Lane Center at Stanford](http://west.stanford.edu/) 
where I research policing reform in America. Before coming to Stanford, I spent 
10 years in education and development policy in Southeast Asia at the Malaysian 
Prime Minister's Department, McKinsey & Company and Teach For Malaysia. 
 
At Stanford, I also teach classes at the Public Policy department in data 
analysis and statistical methods. I am an alum of the 
[Stanford Data Lab](https://datalab.stanford.edu/) and I am the data and dev lead
for an ongoing volunteer project called 
[Bay Area Community](https://www.bayareacommunity.org/) to collate critical resources 
for the Bay Area.

I hold double Masters degrees in Education (Policy, Organization and Leadership 
Studies) and Public Policy from Stanford, and have an undergraduate degree in 
Political Science at Yale.
